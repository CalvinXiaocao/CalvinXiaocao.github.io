What will happen without
cudaDeviceSynchronize()?

cudaDeviceSynchronize() Force the program to wait!

## Synchronization and Parallel Patterns
### Thread Synchronization
* Threads can access each othersâ€™ results through global and shared memory
* Threads need to synchronize to collaborate

### Atomic Memory Operations
perform read-modify-write operations on a memory location in a thread-safe manner.
