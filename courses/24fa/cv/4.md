## Gaussian Pyramid for Detection
Check if the template is in graph

Use Gaussian Pyramid to scale the graph

## Image Upsampling
Simplist approach: neighbour interpolation

$$
g(x) = \sum_{k} c_k u(\frac{x - x_k}{h})
$$

u: kernel function

$$
u(0) = 1, u(k) = 0
$$

Bilinear interpolation (Use area)

### Approximation VS Interpolation

### Joint Bilateral Upsampling

### Laplacian Pyramid
Compute the details of the image

Can be used to compress image
