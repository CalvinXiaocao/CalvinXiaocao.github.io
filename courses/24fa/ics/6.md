# Machine Prog: Procedures
Lecture 6, ICS, Fall 2024

## Mechanisms in Procedures
* Passing control
* Passing data
* Memory management
ABI: Application Binary Interface

## Stack Structures
`Pay attention to the sequence!`

High address high, low address low, stack grows down

### Pushq
pushq *Src*
* Fetch operand at Src
* Decrement %rsp by 8
* Write operand at address given by %rsp

### Popq
popq *Dest*
* Read value at address given by %rsp
* Increment %rsp by 8
* Store value at Dest (usually a register)

The memory doesn't change, only the value of %rsp

## Calling Conventions
* call label
  * push return address on stack
  * jump to label
* Return address
  * Address of the next instruction right after call
* Procedure return: ret
  * Pop address from stack
  * Jump to address

### Register Saving Conventions
Remember the caller/callee saved registers!

---
1-23454321 -> 1 & 12345432  1 == 1如果不相等则失败 向后退回 如果相等则全倒入栈

112-345432 -> 112 & 234543 

11223-4543
