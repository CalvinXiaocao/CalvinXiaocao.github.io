# Machine-Level Programming I: Basics
Lecture 4, ICS, Sep 19

`Golden Rule: Resources are limited.`

## ISA: Instruction Set Architecture

On this course, we will introduce x86-64

* Machine code: the byte-level programs that a processor executes
* Assembly code: A text representation of machine code

## Assembly/Machine Code View

### CPU
CPU: PC, Register, Condition Codes

PC: Program counter, address of next instruction Called RIP in x86-64

Register file: Heavily used program data

Condition codes: store status information about most recent arithmetic or logical operation

### Memory
Byte addressable array

Code and user data

Stack to support procedures

## Machine Instruction Example
```c++
*dest = t;
```

```assembly
movq %rax, (%rbx)
```

## x86-64 Integer Registers
