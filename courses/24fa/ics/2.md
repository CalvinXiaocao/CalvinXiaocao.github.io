# Bits, Bytes and Integers
Lecture 2, ICS 2024 Fall

## Representing Information as BITS
Everything is represented by bits.

### Base 2 Number Representation
* Represent $15213_{10}$ as $11101101101101_2$
* Represent $1.20_{10}$ as $1.0011001100110011[0011]\dots _{2}$
* Represent $1.5213 \times 10^4$ as $1.1101101101101_2 \times 2^{13}$

#### Why computers use binary?

### Encoding Byte Values
* Byte = 8 Bits
* Binary $00000000_2$ to $11111111_2$
* Decimal: $0_{10}$ to $255_{10}$
* Hexadecimal 0x00 to 0xFF

### Data Representations
|C Data Type|Typical 32-bit|x86-64|
|----|----|----|
|char|1|1|
|short|2|2|
|int|4|4|
|long|4|8|
|pointer|4|8|
|float|4|4|
|double|8|8|

不建议使用long类型（可能引出一致性问题）

## Bit-level manipulations
### Boolean Algebra
|&|0|1|
|--|--|--|
|0|0|0|
|1|0|1|

|\||0|1|
|--|--|--|
|0|0|1|
|1|1|1|

|^|0|1|
|--|--|--|
|0|0|1|
|1|1|0|

#### Example: Representing & Manipulating Sets

#### Contrast: Logic Operations in C

&&, ||, !
* View 0 as False, Anything nonzero as True
* Always return 0 or 1
* Early termination (eg: p && *p avoids null pointer access)

#### Shift Operation
* Left shift: x << y
* Right shift: x >> y
  * Logical shift: fill 0 on left
  * Arithmetic shift: fill most significant bit (sign bit) on left
* Undefined Behavior:
  * Shift amount < 0 or >= word size

## Encoding Integers
* unsigned
* Two's complement (flip the bits, and add 1)

### numeric ranges
* Unsigned Valies:
  * UMin = 0
  * UMax = $2^w - 1$
* Two's Complement Values
  * TMin = $-2^{w-1}$
  * TMax = $2^{w-1} - 1$

### Mapping signed and unsigned

### Signed vs. unsigned in C
* Constants
  * By default are considered to be signed integers.
  * Unsigned if have "U" suffix, eg. 4294967259U
* Casting
  * Explicit casting & Implicit casting

```c++
int tx, ty;
unsigned ux, uy;
tx = (int) ux;
uy = (unsigned) ty;
```

### Casting surprises
#### Expression evaluation
If there is a mix of unsigned and signed in single expression, signed values implicitely cast to **unsigned**!!!! (-1 > 0U)

`-2147483647-1, not -2147483648! otherwise it will not represent TMIN`

### Sign Extension
* signed: fill most significant bit (sign bit) on left
* unsigned: zeros added

### Truncation
* No sign change
  * $2 = 00010_2 = 0010_2$
  * $-6 = 11010_2 = 1010_2$
* Sign change
  * $10 = 01010_2$
  * $-6 = 1010_2$
  * mod operation

### Operations
#### Unsigned Addition
* standard addition function
* implement modular arithmetic, carry the highest bit into discard carry
* overflow may happen

#### Two's complement addition
* TAdd and UAdd have identical Bit-level behavior

#### Multiplication
maintaining exact results is done in software if needed.

#### Power-of-2 Multiply with Shift
* u << k gives $u \times 2^k$

#### Why should I use unsigned?
```c++
unsigned i;
for (i = cnt - 2; i >= 0; --i)
    a[i] += a[i + 1] // evaluate forever
```
OH NO!!! But there is a proper way.
```c++
unsigned i;
for (i = cnt - 2; i < count; --i)
    a[i] += a[i + 1] // this time OK.
```

`When should I use signed?`

**DO** use when performing modular arithmetic.

**DO** use when using bits to represent sets.

## Byte-oriented Memory Organization
### machine word
* Any given computer has a "word size"
* Until recently, most machines used 32 bits (4 Bytes) as word size

### Byte ordering
how are the bytes within a multi-byte word ordered in memory
* Big Endian
* Little Indian
